# Understand 
"Input is array (i,j) of integers and target, Output is array"

# Plan
"Iterate thru list to find the sum of two integers that add up to target"

# Execute

def csSortedTwoSum(numbers, target):
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(len(numbers)):
            if i != j and numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target:
                return [i,j]

# Review
"No need to write print, return command works"
